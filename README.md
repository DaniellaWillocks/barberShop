# Barbershop
## CUNY Tech Prep Fullstack Web Application

The full stack application that we would like to create allows clients to have access to the current number of people waiting or scheduled for an appointment in local barbershops. Clients can search for and locate barbershops on the app using their current location or defining a particular location where they would like the app to search for barbershops. Upon selecting a barbershop, a client can view the barbershop’s profile where they’ll primarily be presented a visual of the current number of people in queue for a barber among other details. Clients can schedule an appointment or request a walk-in service, or search for another available barbershop. After scheduling or requesting, the client will be added to and thus monitor their current position in the queue on our app. When the client becomes 2nd in the queue, the app will send a notification to the client letting them know that they have a 10-minute window to get close to the proximity of the barbershop before being pushed to the end of the line.
